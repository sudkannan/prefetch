= Introduction =

This page will contain information about progress of implementation.

= Timeline and progress =
  * April - May 2007
    * setting up project (*done*)
    * establishing contact with Ubuntu developers (*done*)
    * establishing contact with preload developers (*done*)
    * establishing contact with bootcache developers (*done*)
    * establishing contact with ext3 developers (*done*)
    * submitting disk layout tool for review by ext3 developers (*done*)
  * 1st half of June: implementation of tracing facility and integration with Ubuntu boot scripts, analysis of impact on boot time.
    * creating development environment (_in progress_)
    * creating measurement metrics (_in progress_)
      * OpenOffice document to measure startup time
      * Firefox script to measure startup time
      * Scripts to measure startup time
      * Kernel I/O wait time metric
    * evaluation of pagecache as tracing tool
    * integration of tracing into boot scripts
    * integration of prefetching into boot scripts
  * 2nd half of June - 1st half of July: implementation of hooking into application start, analysis of impact and performance of prefetching during application start.
  * 2nd half of July - improving disk layout tool, intensive testing and analysis of impact.
  * August - in case of slips, time to fix problems, otherwise implementing metadata prefetching and partial prefetching during boot. 
  * September and later - writing a paper describing results of analysis for later submission to Linux conferences, improving things which were identified as problems during analysis of implemented solution.
