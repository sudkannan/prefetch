#labels Featured

= Introduction =

This page will contain information about progress of implementation.

= Timeline and progress =
  * April - May 2007
    * setting up project (*done*)
    * establishing contact with Ubuntu developers (*done*)
    * establishing contact with preload developers (*done*)
    * establishing contact with bootcache developers (*done*)
    * establishing contact with ext3 developers (*done*)
    * submitting disk layout tool for review by ext3 developers (*done*)
  * 1st half of June: implementation of tracing facility and integration with Ubuntu boot scripts, analysis of impact on boot time.
    * creating development environment (*done*)
      * Installing Gutsy (*done*) 
      * Compiling custom gutsy kernel (*done*)
    * creating measurement metrics (*done*)
      * Open Office document to measure startup time (*done*) (see MeasuringOpenOfficeStartupTime)
      * Firefox script to measure startup time (_cancelled_)
      * Scripts to measure startup time (*done*)
      * Kernel I/O wait time metric (*done*, already in kernel as delay io stats)
    * measuring cold and warm startup time
      * OpenOffice startup time (see OpenOfficeStartupTimeResults) (*done*)
      * Firefox startup time (_cancelled_)
    * evaluation of pagecache as tracing tool (*done*)
    * integration of tracing into boot scripts  (*done*, see TestingBootPrefetching)
    * integration of prefetching into boot scripts  (*done*, see TestingBootPrefetching)
  * 2nd half of June - 1st half of July: implementation of hooking into application start, analysis of impact and performance of prefetching during application start.
     * Tracing based on pagecache (*done*)
     * Prefetching during application startup (_in progress_, see InitialPrefetchingImplementationResults)
     * Tests of impact of prefetching during application startup (_in progress_, see InitialPrefetchingImplementationResults)
  * 2nd half of July - improving disk layout tool, intensive testing and analysis of impact.
  * September and later - writing a paper describing results of analysis for later submission to Linux conferences, improving things which were identified as problems during analysis of implemented solution.
