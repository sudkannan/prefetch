#summary Description of problem with shorter OpenOffice startup time on custom compiled Gutsy kernel and experiments done to locate the problem
#labels openoffice,startup,customkernel,gutsy,hdparm

= Introduction =
In the course of experiments with cold and warm startup time of OpenOffice, custom compiled kernel from Ubuntu Git repository was tried and cold startup time was measured in the range of ~9 seconds, which is much shorter than ~14 seconds measured for standard Gutsy kernel (see OpenOfficeStartupTimeResults) which comes precompiled and even shorter than ~11 seconds measured for startup after drop_caches.

= Tests =
== Test 1 ==
Manually measured OpenOffice startup time in custom compiled kernel, which caused noticing the problem.


=== Test description ===
Test machine: [TestMachineKL1 KL1]

Test environment: 
  * [KubuntuGutsyKL1 Kubuntu Gutsy KL1] with updates as of 2006-06-10.
  * Custom compiled Ubuntu kernel from Ubuntu kernel git tree (see [http://prefetch.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/results/descriptions/environments/kubuntu-gutsy-kl1/custom-kernel-rc3-kl1 git index files and configs] (compiled on Kubuntu Dapper machine)
  * Standard desktop environment.

Test preparation: 
  * none

Measurements repeatability:
  * several runs with different config options

=== Conclusion ===
  * Tests show much shorter times than measured for standard precompiled Gutsy kernel.
  * Manual tests do not provide reliable repeatability. automatic tests are needed.
