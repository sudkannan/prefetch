#summary Running test version of kernel with boot prefetching
#labels Instructions

= Introduction =
First testing version of kernel with automatic boot prefetching and tracing is available.

This version is precompiled for Debian-based systems (tested on Ubuntu Gutsy, other distributions might not work).

Standard disclaimer applies: this is experimental version, it might damage your system use at your own risk and only on systems where you have backups.

= Installation =

In order to use kernel with prefetching:
  * Download [http://prefetch.googlecode.com/files/linux-image-2.6.22.1-9pf.3_2.6.22-9pf.3_i386.deb kernel linux-image deb]
  * Install linux-image deb package
  * *Remove readahead package* using: `sudo apt-get remove --purge readahead` - please note that this will cause removing (x/k/edu)ubuntu-desktop package.
  * Download [http://prefetch.googlecode.com/files/prefetch_0.2.1_i386.deb userspace prefetch support deb] and install it using: `dpkg -i prefetch*.deb`

Now reboot and select "kernel 2.6.22.1-9pf.3" during boot. 

Please measure boot time and report results in order to check effectiveness of prefetching support.

= Uninstallation =
In order to remove kernel with prefetching:
  # Reboot into standard (non-prefetching) kernel.
  # Remove prefetch userspace support files using `apt-get remove --purge prefetch`
  # Install readahead and (x/k/edu)ubuntu-desktop package.
  # Remove linux-image package with prefetching support (with "pf" in name).
