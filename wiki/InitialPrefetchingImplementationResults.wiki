= Introduction =
These are the results of early implementation of prefetching module. The aim of these tests is to identify strengths and weaknesses of this approach and draw conclusions on subsequent work.

== Test 1 ==
This test purpose is to check if prefetch tracing works well and why results with prefetching module enabled are the same as without prefetching module.

The test was done using prefetching module running in parallel to blktrace, which records IOs.

=== Test description ===
Test machine: [TestMachineKL1 KL1]

Test environment: 
  * [KubuntuGutsyKL1 Kubuntu Gutsy KL1] with updates as of 2006-06-10.
  * Standard desktop environment.
  * blktrace using network to send trace to other machine
  * prefetch module with async prefetching

Test preparation: 
  * first run to get the trace in prefetching module

Measurements repeatability:
  * 5 runs of OpenOffice, second run analyzed as first run was to get trace for prefetching module
  * each OpenOffice run with drop_caches=3 

Tools:
   * blktrace to get trace of IO activity
   * e2block2file to transform IO trace (sectors accesses) into inode numbers + offsets
   * dump of prefetch trace contents (using /proc/prefetch)
   * [http://prefetch.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tools/compare-blktrace-with-prefetch-trace.py script] to merge results of IO trace, e2block2file map and prefetch trace into one trace

Raw results are at: 
http://prefetch.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/results/openoffice/prefetching/testmachine-kl1/test-1-prefetching-with-blktrace/
  * hda1.blktrace-**.0.bz2 files are blktrace traces 
  * prefetch-trace-** files are results of cat /proc/prefetch after openoffice is run. 
  * openoffice_times.txt.bz2 is timing of startup along with io ticks and  /proc/pid/stat line 
  * blktrace-prefetch-comparison-20070702-11:52:15.txt.bz2 a result of merge of second run of OpenOffice startup using  compare-blktrace-with-prefetch-trace.py 

Merged file shows for each read request noticed by blktrace the following values: 
  * timestamp relative to first request 
  * disk sector 
  * block number (sector relative to partition start) 
  * application binary name (first few letters) 
  * inode number 
  * offset in inode 
  * whether sector was found in prefetch trace: 
    * found_in_prefetch - found 
    * missing_in_prefetch - not found 
    * indirect_block - block is indirect block 
  * filename (as found by e2block2file)

=== Conclusions ===
  # Prefetch tracing does not notice directory reads (which is not surprising, as they are not in pagecache) 
  # Prefetch tracing misses some small files, apparently they are evicted from cache pretty quickly or inodes are discarded. 
   # Prefetch tracing misses some accesses to libraries (but not other  accesses) and some accesses to big files (for example splash image) -  this is pretty surprising, but it might be the same problem as with small files, the pages might be used only once for initialization and  discarded afterwards. 
  # OpenOffice is using its own manually crafted prefetch scheme using "pagein" application which pulls into memory libraries upon OpenOffice start.
