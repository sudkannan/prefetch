= Ways of measuring OpenOffice startup time =
== Start with document which calls macro to quit OpenOffice ==

The idea is to prepare a document which upon loading calls macro which quits OpenOffice.

This approach does not work due to bug in OpenOffice - when quit command is executed, OpenOffice crashes. 

Adding a 10 seconds delay before quitting OpenOffice does not help - apparently calling quit from Basic macro is not supported.

== Start with document which runs program when it is loaded ==
The idea is to prepare a document which upon loading calls a program which will record the time and/or other metrics.
