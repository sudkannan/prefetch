This project aims at providing complete Linux solution for prefetching data necessary for fast start of application (and the whole system during boot).

Information about progress of implementation during Google Summer of Code 2007 is on Soc2007Progress page. However this project is aimed at general prefetching solution for Linux, so anyone interested in prefetching is welcome to join in - please register in our prefetch-devel mailing list and introduce yourself.

Introduction to prefetching along with introductory notes is on [Introduction](Introduction.md) page.
